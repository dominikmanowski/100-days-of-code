### Day 1: January 1, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've started JavaScript30 and finished the first challenge - JS Drum Kit

**Thoughts** I've discovered that there are more DOM events then click, keydown, keyup and keypress - transitionend e.g. I've also tried to replace attribute selector with dataset, but I've faled.

### Day 4: January 4, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I've finished the 4th challenge of JavaScript30 - Array Cardio Day 1 - and have continued Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification on freeCodeCamp. I've also set up a React App using Parcel - React Playground

**Thoughts** I've struggled a little with array methods - I definitely need more practice. I'm also surprised how easy it is to set up a React project with Parcel
