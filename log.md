# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've tarted JavaScript30 and finished the first challenge - JS Drum Kit

**Thoughts** I've discovered that there are more DOM events then click, keydown, keyup and keypress - transitionend e.g. I've also tried to replace attribute selector with dataset, but I've faled.
